# Project Structure

Most of the code is written inside the /api/src/ directory:

- Emails: Email templates used
- Handlers: Contain the actual code that is execured when the endpoint is called
- Helpers: a bunch of useful classes for emailing, validations, etc.
- Middleware: read only, does stuff like error handling.
- Routes: The endpoints.
- Migrations: all the migration files available.
- Seeds: Seeders to fill the database with mock content.
